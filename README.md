Collaborative documentation for www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin

The intent here is to establish whether or not GitHub is suitable for managing various documents on /r/bitcoin, and also serves as a personal exercise for me to learn how to use GitHub effectively since I lack the programming skills necessary to contribute elsewhere.

If you want to help, simply create a new pull request for any of the documents found above. Modifying `Testdoc.txt` will help me get a better handle on managing pull requests, while modifying any other documents will additionally help improve documentation at /r/bitcoin.
